New features:

- ``CheckTessellationInput`` to check building footprint data for potential issues during ``Tessellation`` (#163)
- On demand ``DistanceBand`` spatial weights (neighbors) for larger weight which would not fit in memory (#165)

Enhancements:

- New documentation (#167)
- Support network analysis for full network (#176)
- Options for ``preprocess`` (#180)
- Expose underlying ``simpson`` and ``shannon`` functions (#183)
- ``MeanInterbuildingDistance`` performance (#187)
- ``StreetProfile`` performance refactor (#186)
- Retain attributes in ``network_false_nodes`` (#189)
- Performance improvements in ``elements`` module (#190)
- Performance refactor of ``SharedWallsRatio`` (#191)
- Performance refactor of ``NeighboringStreetOrientationDeviation`` (#192)
- Minor performance improvements (#193, #196)
- Allow specification of verbosity (#195)
- Perfomance enhancements in ``sw_high`` (#198)

Bug fixes:

- ``Density`` TypeError for islands (#164)
- Preserve CRS in ``network_false_nodes`` (#181)
- Fixed ``Squareness`` for non-Polygon geom types (#182)
- CRS lost with older geopandas (#188)


Version 0.2.1 (April 15, 2020)
------------------------------

- fixed regression causing ``MeanInterbuildingDistance`` failure (#161)


Version 0.2.0 (April 13, 2020)
------------------------------

API changes:

- ``AverageCharacter`` allows calculation of multiple modes (mean, median, mode) at the same time. Each can be accessed via its own attribute. Apart from ``mean``, none is accessible using ``.series`` anymore. (#147)

Enhancements:

- ``Shannon`` index (#158)
- ``Simpson`` allows Gini-Simpson and Inverse Simpson index modes (#157)
- Diversity classes support categorical values (#159)
- ``SegmentsLength`` allows sum and mean at the same time (#146)
- ``AverageCharacter`` allows calculation of multiple modes (mean, median, mode) at the same time (#147)
- Better compatibility with OSMnx Graphs (#149)
- ``Orientation`` support LineString geometry (#156)
- ``AreaRatio`` for uneven number of features (#135)
- Performance improvements (#144, #145, #152, #155)

Bug fixes:

- float precision errors in ``network_false_nodes`` (#133)
- ``network_false_nodes`` for multiindex (#136)
- ``BlocksCount`` no neighbors error (#139, #140)
- LineString Z support in ``nx_to_gdf`` (#148)
- accidental 'rtd' print (#150)
- ``CentroidCorner`` may fail for Polygon Z (#151)


Version 0.1.1 (December 15, 2019)
---------------------------------

Small bug-fix release:

- fix for ``AreaRatio`` resetting index of resulting Series (#127)
- fix for ``network_false_nodes`` to work with GeoSeries (#128)
- fix for incomplete spatial_weights and missing neighbors. Instead of raising KeyError momepy now returns np.nan for affected row. np.nan is also returned if there are no neighbors (instead of 0). (#131)
