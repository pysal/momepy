------------------------------

API changes:

- ``AverageCharacter`` allows calculation of multiple modes (mean, median, mode) at the same time. Each can be accessed via its own attribute. Apart from ``mean``, none is accessible using ``.series`` anymore. (#147)

Enhancements:

- ``Shannon`` index (#158)
- ``Simpson`` allows Gini-Simpson and Inverse Simpson index modes (#157)
- Diversity classes support categorical values (#159)
- ``SegmentsLength`` allows sum and mean at the same time (#146)

- Better compatibility with OSMnx Graphs (#149)
- ``Orientation`` support LineString geometry (#156)
- ``AreaRatio`` for uneven number of features (#135)
- Performance improvements (#144, #145, #152, #155)

Bug fixes:

- float precision errors in ``network_false_nodes`` (#133)
- ``network_false_nodes`` for multiindex (#136)
- ``BlocksCount`` no neighbors error (#139, #140)
- LineString Z support in ``nx_to_gdf`` (#148)
- accidental 'rtd' print (#150)
- ``CentroidCorner`` may fail for Polygon Z (#151)


Version 0.1.1 (December 15, 2019)
---------------------------------

Small bug-fix release:

- fix for ``AreaRatio`` resetting index of resulting Series (#127)
- fix for ``network_false_nodes`` to work with GeoSeries (#128)
- fix for incomplete spatial_weights and missing neighbors. Instead of raising KeyError momepy now returns np.nan for affected row. np.nan is also returned if there are no neighbors (instead of 0). (#131)
