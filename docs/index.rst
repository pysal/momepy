Introduction
------------

Momepy is a project allowing advanced quantitative analysis of urban
morphology. Embracing principles of *Urban Morphometrics* (Dibble,
2017), this toolkit aims to provide tools for the development of complex
frameworks for a description of urban structures.

    *momepy* stands for Morphological Measuring in Python

The development of momepy is still in its initial phase. The whole
structure of the package can always be changed, until the release of
first versions on PIP. Momepy is a result of ongoing research of `Urban
Design Studies Unit (UDSU) <http://udsu-strath.com>`__ supported by the
Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation as a part of “The Urban Form
Resilience Project” in partnership with University of Strathclyde in Glasgow,
UK.

Comments, suggestions, feedback, and contributions, as well as bug
reports, are very welcome.
