Introduction
------------

Momepy is a project allowing advanced quantitative analysis of urban
morphology. Embracing principles of *Urban Morphometrics* (Dibble,
2017), this toolkit aims to provide tools for the development of complex
frameworks for a description of urban structures.

    *momepy* stands for Morphological Measuring in Python

Momepy is a result of ongoing research of `Urban
Design Studies Unit (UDSU) <http://udsu-strath.com>`__ supported by the
Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation as a part of “The Urban Form
Resilience Project” in partnership with University of Strathclyde in Glasgow,
UK.

Comments, suggestions, feedback, and contributions, as well as bug
reports, are very welcome.
