Introduction
------------

Momepy is a project allowing advanced quantitative analysis of urban
morphology. Embracing principles of *Urban Morphometrics* (Dibble,
2017), this toolkit aims to provide tools for the development of complex
frameworks for a description of urban structures.

    *momepy* stands for Morphological Measuring in Python

The development of momepy is still in its initial phase. The whole
structure of the package can always be changed, until the release of
first versions on PIP. Momepy is a result of ongoing research of `Urban
Design Studies Unit (UDSU) <http://udsu-strath.com>`__ supported by the
Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation as a part of “The Urban Form
Resilience Project” in partnership with University of Strathclyde in Glasgow,
UK.

Comments, suggestions, feedback, and contributions, as well as bug
reports, are very welcome.

Install
-------

Momepy is not yet released. At this moment, you can either download the GitHub
repository to work with ``momepy`` or install the latest development version
from GitHub::

  pip install git+git://github.com/martinfleis/momepy.git

Please ensure that you have all dependencies installed as ``momepy`` setup
currently does not specify dependency requirements.
Momepy depends on the following packages: ``geopandas``, ``libpysal``
and ``tqdm``. All of the packages are currently required, which will be
changed in future.
