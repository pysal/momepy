This user guide covers essential features of momepy, mostly in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks. Reading this guide, you will learn:

- data structure used in momepy,
- how to generate morphological elements like morphological tessellation and link them all together,
- how to calculate simple morphometric characters,
- how to calculate morphometric characters based on multiple sources,
- how to use spatial weights matrix with momepy, and
- how to do network analysis.

Notebooks cover just a small selection of functions as an illustration of principles. For a full overview of momepy capabilities, head to API.
