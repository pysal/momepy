Generating morphological elements
=================================

Apart from morphometric analysis, momepy can generate certain kinds of
morphological elements and link different elements together via
unique_id (see `Data structure`_). The main feature of ``elements``
module is an algorithm generating **morphological tessellation** and
consequent one generating blocks based on geometry of morphological
tessellation.
