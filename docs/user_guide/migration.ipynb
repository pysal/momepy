    "# Migration to momepy 1.0 API\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with version 0.8, momepy contains a completely new API (and refactored internals) that will become the only API in the momepy 1.0. Given this is a complete reimplementation of nearly the entire package, it is not compatible with the legacy class-based API. This notebook contains a succinct migration guide, highlighting the key differences between the two APIs and outlines required changes to existing code to make it compatible with the upcoming 1.0 release."

    "## Reliance on index\n",
    "\n",
    "When we need to capture the relationship between two objects (e.g., a `GeoDataFrame` and its `Graph`), the primary method is to rely on index. Unlike momepy 0.7, which heavily depends on columns with IDs mapping rows of one GeoDataFrame to the other, the new API attempts to minimise use of such columns. Below is the overview of the logic used in various situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry and Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is easy. `Graph` is mapped to geometry (either a `GeoSeries` or a `GeoDataFrame`) via index of the GeoPandas object. \n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "contiguity = graph.Graph.build_contiguity(geometry)\n",
    "momepy.neighbor_distance(geometry, contiguity)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we ensure that the index of `geometry` does not change and, in some cases, that the order of rows is also preserved to ensure the mapping of values to sparse arrays is not mismatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series and Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of the case above is linking a `pandas.Series` to the `Graph`. Such a situation assumes that the index of the `Series` is equal to the index of the original geometry from which the `Graph` was created.\n",
    "\n",

    "# typically, the Series is taken directly from the DataFrame\n",
    "contiguity = graph.Graph.build_contiguity(geometry)\n",
    "momepy.alignment(geometry[\"orientation\"], contiguity)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry and two Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Another subset is when you need to link geometry to two Graphs. In that case, both Graphs need to be based on the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "adjacency_graph = graph.Graph.build_contiguity(geometry)\n",
    "neighborhood_graph = graph.Graph.build_distance_band(\n",
    "\tgeometry, \n",

    "\tneighborhood_graph,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometry and Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "When linking two geometry arrays together – for example capturing which building belongs to which street segment, or which building belongs to which block/enclosure – you cannot rely solely on indices as the two objects do not match.
