    """Generate morphological tessellation.

    Morpohological tessellation is a method to divide space into cells based on
    building footprints and Voronoi tessellation. The function wraps
    :func:`libpysal.cg.voronoi_frames` and provides customized default parameters
    following :cite:`fleischmann2020`.

    Tessellation requires data of relatively high level of precision
    and there are three particular patterns causing issues:

        1. Features will collapse into empty polygon - these
            do not have tessellation cell in the end.
        2. Features will split into MultiPolygons - in some cases,
            features with narrow links between parts split into two
            during 'shrinking'. In most cases that is not an issue
            and the resulting tessellation is correct anyway, but
            sometimes this results in a cell being a MultiPolygon,
            which is not correct.
        3. Overlapping features - features which overlap even
            after 'shrinking' cause invalid tessellation geometry.

    All three types can be tested using :class:`momepy.CheckTessellationInput`.

    See :cite:`fleischmann2020` for details of implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : GeoSeries | GeoDataFrame
        A GeoDataFrame or GeoSeries containing buildings to tessellate the space around.
    clip : str | shapely.Geometry | GeoSeries | GeoDataFrame | None
        Polygon used to clip the Voronoi polygons, by default "bounding_box". You can
        pass any option accepted by :func:`libpysal.cg.voronoi_frames` or geopandas
        object that will be automatically unioned.
    shrink : float, optional
        The distance for negative buffer to generate space between adjacent polygons).
        By default 0.4
    segment : float, optional
        The maximum distance between points after discretization. By default 0.5

    Returns

    GeoSeries

    """Generate enclosed tessellation

    Enclosed tessellation is an enhanced :func:`morphological_tessellation`, based on
    predefined enclosures and building footprints. We can see enclosed tessellation as
    two-step partitioning of space based on building footprints and boundaries (e.g.
    street network, railway). Original morphological tessellation is used under the hood
    to partition each enclosure.

    Tessellation requires data of relatively high level of precision and there are three
    particular patterns causing issues:

        1. Features will collapse into empty polygon - these
            do not have tessellation cell in the end.
        2. Features will split into MultiPolygons - in some cases,
            features with narrow links between parts split into two during 'shrinking'.
            In most cases that is not an issue and the resulting tessellation is correct
            anyway, but sometimes this results in a cell being a MultiPolygon, which is
            not correct.
        3. Overlapping features - features which overlap even
            after 'shrinking' cause invalid tessellation geometry.

    All three types can be tested using :class:`momepy.CheckTessellationInput`.

    The index of the resulting GeoDataFrame links the input buildings with the output
    geometry. Enclosures with no buildings are also included in the output with negative
    index. Ensure that the input geometry has unique non-negative index for this to work
    correctly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : GeoSeries | GeoDataFrame
        A GeoDataFrame or GeoSeries containing buildings to tessellate the space around.
    enclosures : GeoSeries
        The enclosures geometry, which can be generated using :func:`momepy.enclosures`.
    shrink : float, optional
        The distance for negative buffer to generate space between adjacent polygons).
        By default 0.4
    segment : float, optional
        The maximum distance between points after discretization. By default 0.5
    threshold : float, optional
        The minimum threshold for a building to be considered within an enclosure.
        Threshold is a ratio of building area which needs to be within an enclosure to
        inlude it in the tessellation of that enclosure. Resolves sliver geometry
        issues. If None, the check is skipped and all intersecting buildings are
        considered. By default 0.05
    n_jobs : int, optional
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. -1 means using all available cores.
        By default -1

    Returns
    -------
    GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame with an index matching the index of input geometry and a column
        matching the index of input enclosures.
