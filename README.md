![momepy: urban morphology measuring toolkit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinfleis/momepy/master/docs/logo.png)

## Introduction
Momepy is a project allowing advanced quantitative analysis of urban morphology. Embracing principles of *Urban Morphometrics* (Dibble, 2017), this toolkit aims to provide tools for the development of complex frameworks for a description of urban structures.

> *momepy* stands for Morphological Measuring in Python

The development of momepy is still in its initial phase. The whole structure of the package can always be changed, until the release of first versions on PIP. Momepy is a result of ongoing research of [Urban Design Studies Unit (UDSU)](http://udsu-strath.com) supported by the Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation as a part of “The Urban Form Resilience Project” in partnership with University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK.

Comments, suggestions, feedback, and contributions, as well as bug reports, are very welcome.

## Documentation
Documentation of `momepy` is available at [docs.momepy.org](https://docs.momepy.org/).

## Install
You can install `momepy` using Conda from `conda-forge` (recommended):

or from PyPI using `pip`:
